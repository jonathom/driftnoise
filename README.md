### Git Rebase

* `git status`
* `git diff`
* `git commit`
* `git commit -a` its like an add+commit
* `git log`
* `git rebase -i specify-gdal-headers~3` do an interactive rebase on that branch, go three commits back. Instructions are shown in the editor, (`pick`, `squash` (like done here) etc.), then in case of squash the commit message could be altered afterwards
* `git log`
* `git commit --amend` change the commit msg of last commit in case of typo
* `git push` fails in this case, because history on origin is different
* `git push --force-with-lease` force push but notify other ppl working on the branch

* `git push -u origin branch` push local branch thats never been pushed to origin

### grep
* surpress error msg when using `grep`: `grep -r "priima" / 2>&-`
